# Coverage Report

## Summary
- Relevant topics identified from PDFs: 30
- Topics mapped to manual sections: 30
- Coverage status: 30/30 (100%)

## What Was Missing and Added
- Unified navigation to a single module source (`allModulesData.json`) to remove duplicate/legacy paths.
- Added missing quality sections in module pages: troubleshooting, labs, video, and explicit source blocks (PDF + Microsoft Docs).
- Added per-module video mapping and source references.
- Added explicit module-level source links to Microsoft Learn/Docs for technical validation.

## Notes
- One module (`4.1`) still requires a curated capstone-specific video link (`VIDEO_LINK_NEEDED`).
